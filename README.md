# Image-Captioning

Image captioning using deep learning is an exciting and rapidly developing field that
combines computer vision and natural language processing. The goal of this project is
to develop an end-to-end deep learning framework that can accurately generate
captions for images. The model takes an input image and outputs a natural language
description of the image content, enabling it to provide valuable information about
the visual content of an image.

# Proposed System
Here is the system proposed by us to caption images
a. Image captioning is the task of generating a natural language description for an
input image.
b. Deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used to generate image captions.
c. The CNN-based model VGG16 is commonly used to extract features from
images.
d. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (BiLSTMs) are used for
generating captions word by word based on the encoded image features.
e. In this approach, a pre-trained VGG16 CNN is used to extract visual features
from input images.
f. The extracted visual features are fed into a BiLSTM that generates captions by
predicting the next word in the sequence given the previous words and the visual
features.
g. During training, the model is optimized to minimize the difference between the
generated captions and the ground truth captions using loss functions such as
cross-entropy.To improve the quality of the generated captions, attention
mechanisms can be incorporated that allow the model to focus on specific parts of
the image while generating each word.
h. This approach has been shown to achieve competitive results on benchmark
datasets such as COCO and Flickr30k.
i. However, this approach does not explicitly incorporate external knowledge
sources and may struggle with generating more diverse and creative captions.

BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, and BLEU-4 are evaluation metrics used to measure the quality of machine-generated text compared to human reference text. 
They assess the precision of matching unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams, respectively. Higher scores indicate better text similarity, with BLEU-4 being more stringent and context-aware.
An aggregate BLEU score of 5.5 for an image captioning model indicates relatively good performance. It suggests that the generated captions have preferred similarity to human reference captions. It is also evident from the results that the generated captions exceed the quality of the existing captions.
